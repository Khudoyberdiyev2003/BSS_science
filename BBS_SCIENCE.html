                   B ack in June, University College London (UCL)
                   <br>announced that it would be denaming the Galton
                   <br>Lecture Theatre as "one step in a range of actions
                   <br>aimed at acknowledging and addressing the
                   <br>university's historical links with the eugenics
                   <br>movement." Sir Francis Galton, whom the lecture theatre
                   <br>was named after, was a Victorian scientist who founded
                   <br>the British study of eugenics. But does removing Galton's
                   <br>name minimise, or even hide, his role in shaping our
                   <br>society today? We posed this question to Subhadra Das, a
                   <br>science historian and curator at UCL, who has spent the
                   <br>last eight years looking after the items in the university's
                   <br>Galton collection.

                <p><b class="name-6">HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE RENAMING
                    <br> OF THE GALTON LECTURE THEATRE?</b>
                <br>
                    I'm very pleased, because it's something that people have
                    <br>wanted to happen for a long time and it's definitely the
                    <br>right thing to do. But I hope that my community at the
                    <br>university also realises that this is really just the beginning.
                    <br> That we've so much work to do when it comes to these ideas
                    <br> and these ways of thinking.

                    <b class="name-6">WHO WAS GALTON?</b>
                    <br>Sir Francis Galton is probably the most famous Victorian
                    <br>scientist not a lot of people have heard of. I had never heard

                    of him until I started curating the collection. Galton was many
                    <br>things; he was an explorer in Africa, he was a meteorologist,
                    <br>a statistician, a biologist.
                    <br>He's also the man who came up with the word 'eugenics'.
                    <br>He coined the term. I think a lot of people, if they hear the word
                    <br>eugenics, probably think about the Nazis and the horrors of the
                    <br>Holocaust. But actually, the story is a lot older and it's a lot
                    <br>more British than that. 
                </p>
                <p><b class="name-6">EUGENICS HAS A BIG HISTORY IN THE UK THEN?</b>
                <br>Absolutely. It's not something to be proud of, but it is a
                <br> British invention.
                <br> Galton was probably as famous in his lifetime as his very
                <br> famous cousin - a man called Charles Darwin. Galton added
                <br> on to Darwin's theory of evolution his own particular genius.
                <br> What he said was, if it's the case that humans are like any other
                <br> animal, then we should be able to breed better humans in the
                <br> same way that we breed animals to suit our own purposes.
                <br> Because of the time in which he was operating, his theories
                <br> built on existing ideas to do with scientific racism. These were
                <br> ideas that came out of the Enlightenment in Europe, ways
                <br> of classifying different kinds of humans, ways that we now
                <br>know to be incorrect.
                <br> Probably the most dangerous thing about those ideas was
                <br> that there was a hierarchy involved. So having classified
                <br> different human beings as being white or being European, or

                <p>being black and being African, or being brown
                   <br>and from India like me, there was an inherent
                    <br> hierarchy that was put in place by European
                    <br> scientists - a hierarchy that they mistakenly
                    <br> believed meant white European people were better
                    <br> than everybody else.

                <p>
                    <b class="name-6">BUT THAT BELIEF IN EUGENICS AND A HIERARCHY
                       <br>BETWEEN HUMANS IMPACTED THE ENTIRE SCIENTIFIC
                       <br>COMMUNITY, DIDN'T IT?
                    </b>
                    <br>
                    It did, entirely. Galton is essentially one of the
                    <br>founding fathers of modern statistics. He came up
                    <br>with the principles of correlation, regression to the
                    <br>mean, and was one of the founders of the biometrics
                    <br>school of thought. A lot of the work he did is
                    <br>fundamental to contemporary science and how it
                    <br>works. His ideas about eugenics weren't necessarily
                    <br>all that popular until the turn of the 20th Century.
                    <br>Eugenics probably took off in a considerably bigger
                    <br>way after his lifetime than during it.
                    <br>The thing that I'm mainly concerned about is
                    <br>that we need to be very mindful of where his ideas
                    <br>were coming from and the ways in which they shape
                    <br>our ideas today. That doesn't mean to say that
                    <br> we throw all of Victorian science out the window                    
                    <br>and start again - of course it doesn't. These things

                <b>THE IDEA OF EUGENICS DIDN'T DIE WITH HIM, THEN? </b>
                <br>
                <p>The idea definitely didn't die with him. I think most
                    <br>historians of Galton would say that he would have
                    <br>been horrified by things that his ideas were put to.
                    <br>That he would have been horrified by the sterilisation
                    <br>of people without their consent in the United States.
                    <br> He would be horrified by the sterilisation and the
                    <br>extermination of people in the Holocaust.
                    <br> My view on that is a little bit different, in so far
                    <br>as he may well have considered these to be
                    <br>the important and Earth-shattering historical
                    <br> developments that we think them to be, but I don't
                    <br> know that he would necessarily have thought they
                    <br> were a bad thing. But I need to explore that a little bit
                    <br> more, how he would feel about these things.
                    <br> There's an interview that he gave to a newspaper
                    <br>  called The jewish Chronicle [in 1910]. A Jewish
                    <br> j ournalist asks him how he feels about the
                    <br>  persecution of Jewish people in Russia, and Galton's
                    <br>  response was that it's difficult to talk to any
                    <br>  individual political moment, but that in general,
                    <br>   this person - this Jewish person that he was
                    <br> speaking to - should be grateful that those weaker
                    <br> and lesser individuals within that person's race, as
                    <br> he saw it, were being exterminated for them, because
                    <br> it meant that the Jewish race would become stronger
                    <br> as a result.
                    <br> That journalist asked him, "Don't you feel that
                    <br> that's a very immoral position to hold?" And what
                    <br>  Galton said was that it is neither immoral or moral.
                    <br>It is amoral. It has nothing to do with morality. And
                    <br>that's where things start to become really dangerous,
                    <br>because if scientists believe their work to be
                    <br>apolitical, or that it has nothing to do with morality,
                    <br>that is where disaster strikes. </p>
